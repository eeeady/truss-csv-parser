# truss-csv-parser
## Setup

This project was originally set up on OSX 10.13.6 using Pipenv and Python 3.7.

### Install Pipenv. See full instructions/documentation [here](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

> $ brew install pipenv

### Install dependencies using Pipenv.
Note: This is not necessary as is. The intent was to manage whatever I found this way.

> $ pipenv install

## Running the code

> $ cat file.csv | pipenv run python parser.py

## Testing

Need to add testing!
